# "Shark Tank" Project
In my economics class, my teacher is requiring my peers and I to "create a product and a business proposal as if you were planning to pitch [an] idea to the entrepreneurs on the TV show, Shark Tank."
With my skillset, I decided to make a website that allows for a restaurant or club to allow customers to queue their favorite songs to be played.
Since I have not finished or am even close to finishing, this idea may change and develop overtime. 
*The program here is only a demo of my vision and is only meant to be used for my presentation.*

## Technical Stuff
In short, this is a program intended to run on a web server built using the web framework <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flask_(web_framework)">Flask</a>.
I will add more here once I "finish" the demo and can explain every part in detail.

## Project Documents
Once I finish the demo program, I will add my presentation notes, instructions, and anything else that relates to this project.
